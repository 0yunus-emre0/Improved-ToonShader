# Improved-ToonShader
An "improved toon shader" that works on URP and Built-In Render Piplines.

I improved the shader in this link and i rewrote it for Built-In Render Pipline.

(URP)Simple Toon Shader : https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/urp-simple-toon-shader-243515

Improvements:
- Added Transparency settings.
- Added floody vertex manipulation settings. (These settings are Optional.)
- Rewritten shader for Built-In Render Pipline.
- Fixed "implicit truncation of vector type" shader warnings.

  Note: Shader Tested Windows and Android platforms and it works fine.
